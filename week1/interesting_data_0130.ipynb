All of this was a by focusing on one location and essentially comparing what wages looked like prior to Amazon and after Amazon. In other words, the unit of analysis is the county and the variation is across time with an identified break with Amazon's arrival. This is an interesting story because while (i) seems good (ii) does not seem so great.\n",
