I actually use them a fair amount of time for several reasons: One they are great for creating (small) table like datasets that can be converted to a DataFrame. Second, they are great for converting some value in your data. In one example, I had a dataset that had education catagorized by a string like `[\"primary\", \"secondary\"]` and I wanted to covert it into years of schooling. So I used a dictionary that mapped the words into years. \n",
